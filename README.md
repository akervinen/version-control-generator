| RULES of Kalashnikov the card game (made by Boris) |
+----------------------------------------------------+

The game takes place in exclusion zone in chernobyl.
Objective of the game is to build a gun faster than other players.
First one to build a gun gets to shoot another player and give them damage.
First player to get 20 points wins.
To build a gun, you need A, K, 4 and 7 in your hand.

You need:
- A standard deck of 52 cards (no jokers)
- 2-4 players

Start:
- Shuffle the cards
- Deal 4 cards to each player
- Leave rest of the deck in the middle as a military garbage pile
- Do not show your cards to other players
- Dealer starts

Every turn a player has a chance to swap out one card. Players must always have 4 cards in hand.
You put the card you don't want to a discard pile. You then take a card from the garbage pile.
Then it's next player's turn.
This goes on until any of the players gets a hand of A, K, 4 and 7.

If you have to discard a card that is useful, instead of putting it in the discard pile you put it on the shelf.
Shelf space is shared by all players. Players can also pick cards from there.

When player gets AK47, they have assembled a gun and it's time to shoot.
(You slam your cards on the table and yell KALASHNIKOV CYKA!)
Player gets to choose a card from opponent's hand. Enemy then show's their hand.
The strength of chosen card compared to other cards in opponent's hand decides the damage that the enemy takes. In this game, ace is strongest.
The highest card in opponent's hand gives them most damage (4).
Second highest gives 3 damage, third highest 2 damage and lowest card gives 1 damage.

For example:
IF the hand is A222
    - if you pick A, damage is 4
    - if you pick any of the 2's, damage is 3
    
IF the hand is KKK7
    - if you pick any of the kings, damage is 4
    - if you pick the seven, damage is 1
    
IF the hand is K775
    - K equals the damage of 4
    - either of the 7's equal a damage of 3
    - 5 equals a damage of 1
    
Damage is always counted towards the strongest card.
Otherwise, you can use dice to figure out the damage (1-6).

After shooting, you shuffle the cards again, build again, and shoot again. First player to deal 20 damage wins the game (or 10 for a shorter game).

Extras:
THE GOLDEN KALASHNIKOV
- when you have A, K, 4 and 7 all in the same suit.
- with golden kalashnikov, you hit full damage and double damage.
    - do not pick a card from opponents hand, you just hit 8 damage (12 if using the dice).

If 2 or more players have kalashnikov at the same time, it is a duel.
Players shuffle their cards and choose at the same time card from each other's deck.
The damage is determined based on these cards
(SIDENOTE: does everyone get damage or only the one with the higher card? Ask Boris)
